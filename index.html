        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_car"target="_blank">Formula One cars</a> are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic<a href="https://www.mclaren.com/racing/f1-playbook/downforce/#:~:text=Downforce%20is%20a%20measure%20of,the%20ceiling%20of%20a%20tunnel."target="_blank">downforce</a> . Much of this downforce is generated by front and rear wings, which have the side effect of causing severe turbulence behind each car. The turbulence reduces the downforce generated by a car following directly behind, making it hard to overtake. Major changes to the cars for the 2022 season has seen greater use of ground effect aerodynamics, and modified wings to reduce the turbulence behind the cars, with the goal of making overtaking easier.[3] The cars are dependent on electronics and<a href="https://www.mclaren.com/racing/f1-playbook/aerodynamics/#:~:text=Aerodynamics%20is%20the%20study%20of,track%20to%20create%20more%20grip."target="_blank">aerodynamics</a> , suspension and tyres.<a href="https://getjerry.com/questions/are-f1-cars-equipped-with-traction-control#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%20no%2C%20F1,them%20with%20an%20unfair%20advantage."target="_blank">Traction control</a> , launch control, and automatic shifting, plus other electronic driving aids, were first banned in 1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively.[4]
           <br> With the average annual cost of running a team – designing, building, and maintaining cars, pay, transport – being approximately US$265 million,[5] its financial and political battles are widely reported. On 23 January 2017, Liberty Media completed its acquisition of the Formula One Group, from private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for $8 billion.[6][7]</p>
