        <p>A Formula One race starts with a warm-up lap, called the <a href="https://thestadiumreviews.com/blogs/info/what-is-a-formation-lap-in-f1/"target="_blank">formation lap</a> and the<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pit_lane"target="_blank">pit lanes</a>  are opened of this purpose 30 minutes before the actual race begins. Pit lanes are tracks away from the grid and are parallel to the start/finish line.<br>During this time, the drivers are free to take any number of warm-up drives, without actually going on the grid. After the pit lane closes, the drivers must take their places on the grid in their qualifying order.

            Once all the cars have taken their positions on the grid, the race begins with the starting lights − 10 red lights in 5 pairs of columns.<br>Each column lights one after the other, at an interval of 1 second from left to right direction. After all 5 columns are illuminated, they stay in that way for a few seconds and then all of them are extinguished at once and the race begins.

            If the start is interrupted due to any circumstances, the 5 red lights illuminate again but are not extinguished, instead orange lights are lit up and the race is restarted.<br>The drivers who finish at first, second and third positions at the end of the race stand on a podium and are awarded trophies. A constructor's trophy is also presented to the winner's team.</p>

            <p>The length of the race must be 305 km (260 km in case of Monaco GP) and is defined as "the smallest number of complete laps that exceeds 305 kilometers".The number of laps in a race is obtained by dividing 305 by the length of a lap, which differs from track to track.
                The duration of the race cannot be more than 2 hours. If the allocated time of 2 hours is exceeded, the race is considered to be finished at the end of the ongoing lap.</p>

                <p>Similar to motor sports and other racing competitions, racing flags are used in Formula One to send out various messages and signals to the drivers like the race start or finish, lap indication, bad weather indication, etc.</p>
                <h3 style="color:rgba(8, 8, 8, 0.84);background-color:rgba(255, 24, 1, 0.955);font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Status Flags</h3>
