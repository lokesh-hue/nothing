        <p>What is FORMULA 1? Formula One is one of the most popular sports in the world. It is the highest class of international racing for single-seater formula racing cars. Formula One is sanctioned by the<a href="https://www.fia.com/fia" target="_blank">Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA)</a>   which was established on 20 June 1904. Formula One was inaugurated on 13 May 1950 as the World Drivers’ Championship at Silverstone in the United Kingdom. In 1981 it became known as the FIA Formula One World Championship. <br><br> The races take place on purpose-built tracks certified by the FIA. Most tracks are situated in remote locations well connected with cities. There are a few races such as the British <a href="Grand prix Format.html"target="_blank">Grand Prix </a>  and the Singapore Grand Prix that are held on closed public roads. Formula One is one of the premium forms of racing around the world and draws huge audiences.<br><br>

            A driver participating in a Formula One race should hold a valid Super Licence issued by the FIA. The performance of the drivers and the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_constructors#:~:text=Constructors%20are%20people%20or%20corporate,in%20the%20FIA%20World%20Championship."target="_blank">constructors </a> of the car are evaluated at the end of each race by a points system. At the end of a season, the FIA aggregates the points scored by each and awards two annual World Championships: one each for the drivers and the constructors.</p>
